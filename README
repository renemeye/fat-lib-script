This script is created as a "Build Phase" "Run Script" for Xcode. 
It creates a fat-lib (more than one architecture lib) if you compiled this library for more than one architecture (e.g. for arm and i386)

If you want to use it:
======================

1.) Your Library
 * Start a XCode Project for a static library (iOS)
 * Write your library code

2.) This Script
 * Add a Build Phase (Run Script) for your Target (Project Settings > TARGETS > YourTarget > Build Phases > Add Build Phase > Add Run Script)
 * Copy-Paste this Script to the Script field (or invoke there a run of it)

3.) The Build Settings
 * Create a Build Settings Variable named "COMBINED_FOLDER_NAME". And put in the name of the folder in which the fat-lib should be created (e.g.: "iOS_and_OSX").
 * Get sure that your project compiles your library in different sub-directories for each platform (Set "Build Products Path" to something like: "/Your/Desitination/$(PLATFORM_NAME)") 

4.) Compiling
 * Compile it once for each Platform (e.g. for iOS Simulator and iOS)
